# Running Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi with Tor

I have recently learned about using Tor to allow a Raspberry Pi to be accessed remotely, and have implemented this with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/#why-nextcloud).  Nextcloud is a file-storage service similar to Dropbox, but hosted privately from your own Raspberry Pi.  By using Tor to open up the port occupied by Nextcloud, you will be able to access it without needing to be on the same Wifi network, which allows you to use the collaborative features of Nextcloud.

### Step 1 - Set up Treehouses image

Download the latest treehouses image from http://download.treehouses.io, then use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io) to flash the image onto your SD card.  Be sure to change balenaEtcher's settings to prevent it from automatically unmounting the SD card once it's done flashing.
