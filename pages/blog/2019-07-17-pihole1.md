## Setting up Pihole on boot drive for Raspberry Pi - Part 1

As a member of OLE's Raspberry Pi team, I have recently been tasked with running Pihole concurrently with Planet.  Unfortunately, the two programs occupy the same ports, so I have been working on this one step at a time.  

The first step is to set up Pihole and run it on its own, while Planet is disabled.  The easiest way to disable Planet is to remove the Planet set up in the `autorunonce` file, in the boot drive, essentially creating a *"clean slate"*.

```
#!/bin/bash

treehouses rename treehouses
treehouses expandfs
treehouses button bluetooth

#treehouses wifi <wifiname> [password]
#treehouses ap internet <hotspotname> [password]
#treehouses ap local <hotspotname> [password]
#treehouses bridge <wifiname> <hotspotname> [wifipassword] [hotspotpassword]
```
